# Loops-Conditions
Beetroot Academy - Lesson 27

1. Write a program that requests a number from a user and finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. For example, for number 4 it is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
2. Request two numbers and find only their largest common divisor.
3. Request a number and display all the divisors of it. For example, for number 8 it would be 2, 4, and 8.
4. Define the number of digits in a requested number. For example, there are 4 digits in the number 6834.
5. Request 10 numbers from a user and count, how many are positive, negative, or zero. Also, count odd and even. Display the statistics. There’s only one variable (not 10) needed for input by a user. 
6. Loop a calculator. Request 2 numbers and a sign, solve the problem, display the result and ask if the user wants one more. The loop continues until the user refuses. 
7. Request a number from a user and ask by how many digits to move it. Move the digits and display the result (if the number 123456 needs to be moved by 2 digits, the result will be 345612).
8. Loop day input like this: «Day of the week. Would you like to see the next one?» which continues as long as the user clicks OK.
9. Display the multiplication table of all numbers from 2 to 9. Every number has to be multiplied by 1 to 10. 
10. “Guess the number” game. Suggest a user to think of a number from 0 to 100 and guess it in the following way: every loop iteration needs to divide the range of numbers in half, you represent the result as N and ask the user “Your number > N, < N or == N?” Depending on what the user said, narrow down the range. So the starting range is 0 to 100, divided in half is 50. If the user said the number is > 50, the next range is 51 to 100, and so on, until the user chooses == N.
